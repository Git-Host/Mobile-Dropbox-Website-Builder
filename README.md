Mobile-Dropbox-Website-Builder
==============================

Smartphones have higher quality cameras now than ever. Many of us take most if not all of our photos with our phones. Unfortunately there's no easy way to publish all these great photos to a Portfolio Website.

I built this app as a gift for a photographer. Once this app is deployed to the cloud, regardless of your mobile platform, you can download the dropbox app, create folders (which will populate your Portfolio Website's categories, and drag and drop your favorite phone-captured photos. They are immediately synced to your Dropbox Account and published on your Portfolio Site.
